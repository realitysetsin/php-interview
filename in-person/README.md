# In-Person Interview

In person technical questions are quite different from the technical screen questions. First of all, questions are
not designed to weed out applicants; rather, they are constructed to discover how a candidate works and thinks,
how they would fit into the company. If you've discovered gaps in knowledge during the phone screen, you may use this
opportunity to decide whether they will be an impediment or something you can teach around.

Consequently, technical questions are usually much more open-ended, with multiple valid solutions or approaches.
They invite discussion, coaching, and refactoring along the way. Often they can be optimized well past the time
allotted for an interview.

If candidates are asked technical questions at this stage, they are more often in front of white boards. Because of this
it's less important to see language-specific knowledge or perfect syntax than it is to see problem solving ability,
analytical thinking, communication (asking questions) and reasoning.
