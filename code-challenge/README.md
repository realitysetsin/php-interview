# Coding Challenges

Some companies use take home coding challenges that can be completed by the candidate at his or her own pace.
The argument for these types of assignments is that the work more accurately reflects actual work that the candidate
may encounter in the job environment. It allows them to work on their own dev environments, use their own IDEs,
reference external sites, set up their own tests and optimize their code the way they would in a normal work environment.

There are several downsides though:

1\. By allowing the candidate to operate free of time pressures and distractions, you are removing a very real (though
frustrating) component of real work. We all face time pressures and distractions. It's important that coding challenges
serve as a supplement to in-person interviewing.

2\. There is no real guarantee that the person you are interviewing is the one who completed the coding challenge. In
a real work environment, seeking help would be encouraged. But for the coding challenge, you want to see the candidate's
ability to work/debug/optimize in isolation.

3\. Some developers are beginning to resent coding challenges, primarily because of unscrupulous employers taking
advantage of candidate's time and efforts by either giving excessively long coding challenges or assigning candidates
actual company work that needs to be done. If you decide to implement coding challenges, *always* be respectful of your
candidates' time. And **do not, under any circumstances, assign outstanding work that ought to be completed by an
internal developer.**
